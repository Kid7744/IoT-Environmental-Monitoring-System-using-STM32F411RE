This project is an **IoT-based environmental monitoring system** that uses the **STM32F411RE** microcontroller to collect data from environmental sensors and display it remotely using **ThingSpeak**.

## Components Used

- **STM32F411RE** (Nucleo-64 Board)
- **DHT11** - Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- **LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)** - For measuring ambient light intensity
- **ESP8266 WiFi Module** - For wireless communication
- **ThingSpeak Dashboard** - For real-time data visualization

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of **temperature**, **humidity**, and **light intensity**
- WiFi-enabled data transmission using ESP8266
- Remote data visualization through **ThingSpeak**
